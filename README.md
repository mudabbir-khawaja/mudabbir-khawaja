- 👋 Hi, I’m @mudabbir-khawaja, my friends call me Muddi. I am a born german with pakistani roots. 
- 👀 With international experience from Asia, Europe, and US I believe that a key thriver is diversity. I love the world of business and I am a sucker for public markets (Sometimes more, sometimes less). Finance, Technology and Innovation are my quantitative focus, but culturual interaction, global creative communication is my vision. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code! With the help of Data, I envision myself understanding Business insight out of it. I started coding during my highschool years, where I additionally took the computer science course for my last years. With combined interests in Finance, Marketing, and Data Science as well as interpersonal skills, I want to mark the world of code with my character.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tips on business analytics, data science, data analytics or other coding support. Memes appreciated - obviously! I am heavily interested in Web 3.0, VR & AR. I heavily follow the development of the "Metaverse".
